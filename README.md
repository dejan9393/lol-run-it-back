`yarn dev`

## Troubleshooting
Run It Back requires the LoL client to be running, as it communicates to the LoL API via the client.

It will automatically attempt to open your client from the default path. If this doesn't work, open the client manually and then run the tool.

## Misc

This software is obviously completely free to use.
